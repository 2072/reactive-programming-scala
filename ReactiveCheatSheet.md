<h1>Monads</h1>
For-comprehensions are a 'simplified' way of writing some specific map, flatMap and filter expressions. There are certain properties of data-structures that make these conversions feasible. <b>Monads</b> are structures that define two operations: <b>flatMap</b> and <b>unit</b> which enjoy properties like <b>Associativity of flatMap</b> and <b>simple Left and Right Unit application</b>. These properties of Monads help simplify for-expressions involving them.
